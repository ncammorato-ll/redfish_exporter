# Configuration

Generic types include:

- `<string>` regular string values
- `<float64>` regular float64 value as expected in Golang
- `<timeout>` a string representation of a Golang time.Duration, e.g. `30s`

```yaml
hosts:
  [ <string>: <hostdetail> ]
  default: <hostdetail>
groups:
  [ <string>: <hostdetail> ]
modules: [ <string>: <module> ]
```

## `<hostdetail>`
``` yaml
username: <string>
password: <string>
```

Note that the `default` entry above is useful in order to avoid the exporter failing when attempting to collect from a host not explicitly defined in `hosts`.

## `<module>`
Users of `blackbox_exporter` will be familiar with the concept of [modules (aka probers)](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md#module).
Since `v0.2.0-alpha` released in October 2025, this fork of the redfish_exporter supports a similar concept.
With modules, users may enable only certain bits of collector behavior, tailoring data gathering to specific hosts.
As an example, a host without GPUs wouldn't want to spend network round-trips using the `gpu_collector` prober module, and that may be left out on the client (Prometheus) end.

**Note:** To retain backwards compatibility, the redfish_exporter will default to probing a system using all collectors below except the JSON collector. If this is not desired behavior, users must define a `modules:` configuration in the redfish_exporter, and specify one or more `module` HTTP query parameters on the client end.

**In a future release, users will be required to specify modules in the exporter and client**

Modules follow the below configuration schema:

``` yaml
# The type of prober this module uses
prober: <prober_string>

[ chassis_collector: <chassis_collector> ]
[ gpu_collector: <gpu_collector> ]
[ json_collector: <json_collector> ]
[ manager_collector: <manager_collector> ]
[ system_collector: <system_collector> ]
[ telemetry_collector: <telemetry_collector> ]
```

### `<prober_string>`

One of:

- `chassis_collector`
- `gpu_collector`
- `json_collector`
- `manager_collector`
- `system_collector`
- `telemetry_collector`

### `<chassis_collector>`
[source](../collector/chassis_collector.go)

The Chassis Collector primarily exposes health data from the Chassis API. Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

```

# TYPE redfish_chassis_state gauge
```

Newer platforms — notably the GB200/GB300 NVL72 trays and the MGX NVSwitch tray — do not
implement the deprecated `Thermal` and `Power` schemas at all, and express the same
readings through `Sensors` instead. For those chassis the collector falls back to the
`Sensors` collection, folding readings into the metric families above wherever the meaning
is unambiguous, so a Sensors-only platform produces the same series names as one that
implements `Thermal`/`Power`:

| Redfish `ReadingType` | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| `Temperature` | `redfish_chassis_temperature_celsius` (+ `_sensor_health`, `_sensor_state`) |
| `Rotational` | `redfish_chassis_fan_rpm` (+ min/max/percentage/threshold series) |
| `Voltage` | `redfish_chassis_power_voltage_volts` (+ `_state`) |
| anything else | `redfish_chassis_sensor_{watts,amperes,joules,hertz,percent,reading}` |

`Sensors` is consulted for two distinct reasons, and the reason decides what is emitted:

- **Standing in for the legacy schemas**, on a chassis advertising neither `Thermal` nor
  `Power`. The whole collection is emitted.
- **For the leak detectors alone**, on a chassis that carries them, since their voltages
  live nowhere else. Only those sensors are emitted — otherwise a chassis implementing
  `Thermal` *and* leak detection would publish its temperatures twice under the same series
  name, which fails the whole scrape at registration.

A chassis advertising no `Sensors` collection is never asked for one. This matters more
than it sounds: the `ERoT`/`IRoT` roots are roughly a third of the chassis on an NVL72 tray
or an HGX baseboard, and synthesising `<chassis>/Sensors` for them would cost a 404 apiece
on every scrape.

Readings are not inferred from sensor naming: fan PWM duty cycle and CPU core utilisation
are both `ReadingType: Percent` and neither carries a distinguishing `PhysicalContext`, so
`Percent` reaches the catch-all rather than being assumed to be a fan speed. Sensors that
are simply not wanted are dropped by `sensor_exclude` (below) rather than by a rule in the
collector.

The collection is fetched with `$expand` so the BMC inlines every member body, costing one
request per chassis rather than one per sensor. Measured against captured BMC dumps, the net
change in requests per scrape is **−2 to +2** — the new `Sensors` requests are paid for by a
duplicate `LeakDetection` request this release also removes:

| Platform | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYS-A21GE-NBRT (B200, 39 chassis) | 116 | 115 |
| SYS-821GE-TNHR (H100/H200, 43) | 118–119 | 117–118 |
| ARS-121GL-NB3 (GB300 tray, 42) | 124 | 124 |
| N5500_LD (MGX NVSwitch tray, 12) | 48 | 48 |
| GH200 (4) | 20 | 22 |

A BMC that does not honour `$expand` is **not** fanned out to one request per sensor — that
would multiply load against the BMCs least able to absorb it. Only the leak detector sensors
are then fetched individually and the bulk sensor telemetry is skipped with a warning, so
request count stays flat and the safety-relevant readings still arrive.

#### Leak detection

`redfish_chassis_leak_detector_state` is the signal to alert on. A `Critical` state is a
detector *trip* rather than a confirmed leak — see the classification below — but every trip
warrants a response.

`..._health` carries the same value today, and that is not a coincidence. Every detector on
every platform we have captured is `LeakDetector.v1_1_0`, where `DetectorState` is a `$ref`
to `Resource.Health`, so the two share a single `OK`/`Warning`/`Critical` enum. Either metric
detects a trip, and both did on the three GB300 trays we captured with a tripped detector.

Both are emitted because the schema separates them later. From `v1_3_0` `DetectorState` only
*should* equate to `Health`; `v1_6_0` narrows that to "when the detector is enabled and
functional" and adds that a detector fault — a short, a disconnected cable — is reported
through `Status.Conditions`. So `Health` is the rollup that goes non-OK for a leak *or* a
fault, while `DetectorState` is the leak-specific reading. Prefer `..._state` for leak
alerting so the distinction lands correctly on firmware that implements it.

**Alert on `== 3`, never `>= 2`.** Unlike the health encoding, values above 3 do not mean
"worse than critical": 4 (`Unavailable`) and 5 (`Absent`) mean the detector is not reporting,
so a `> 2` expression would fire a critical leak for an absent detector. Use `== 2` for a
warning-level trip and `== 3` for a critical one.

Note that 4 and 5 only exist from `LeakDetector.v1_6_0`, so on current firmware they are
unreachable and a `>= 4` blind-spot alert cannot fire. The mapping is there so that firmware
gaining those values later is handled correctly rather than silently misread. The same
applies to `redfish_chassis_leak_detector_enabled`: `Enabled` arrives in `v1_3_0` and is
absent everywhere today, so the series is not emitted at all rather than defaulting to 0.

**A faulted detector is currently invisible on the switch trays.** `Status.Conditions` needs
Resource `v1_11_0` and appears in no captured payload, so a trip and a broken detector cannot
be told apart from the state and health metrics alone. On a compute tray the companion
voltage covers this: a disconnected or shorted rope reads *high*, crossing
`..._volts_upper_threshold_critical`. The MGX switch tray's detectors have no companion
sensors, so that check has nothing to read and a dead detector looks like a healthy one.

**Alert on `..._state`; classify with `..._volts`.** Across five captured GB300 trays,
three show a detector reporting `DetectorState: Critical` while its companion voltage sits
at a nominal ~1.72 V, well clear of the lower critical threshold. All three were real
detector trips and none was a coolant leak: the cause was dust bridging the sense contacts.
The detector measures resistance across those contacts, so anything conductive enough to
bridge them trips it, and a dust bridge trips the discrete state without pulling the divider
voltage far enough to cross its own threshold.

That disagreement is the diagnosis, available at alert time rather than after someone opens
the tray. Page on the state, and let the voltage decide which runbook fires:

```promql
# 1. Confirmed wet-out: the trip is corroborated by the analog reading. Coolant leak.
redfish_chassis_leak_detector_state == 3
  and on (instance, chassis_id, leak_detection_id, leak_detector_id)
    redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts <= redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts_lower_threshold_critical

# 2. Trip with the voltage present and nominal: contamination across the sense contacts is
#    the likeliest cause. Real, and worth a physical inspection, but not a leak response.
(redfish_chassis_leak_detector_state == 3
  and on (instance, chassis_id, leak_detection_id, leak_detector_id)
    redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts)
  unless on (instance, chassis_id, leak_detection_id, leak_detector_id)
    redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts <= redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts_lower_threshold_critical

# 3. Trip on a detector that publishes no voltage at all (the MGX NVSwitch tray). Not
#    classifiable without opening the tray, so treat it at leak severity.
redfish_chassis_leak_detector_state == 3
  unless on (instance, chassis_id, leak_detection_id, leak_detector_id)
    redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts
```

**The arms must cover the whole of `..._state == 3` between them**, which is why the third
exists: without it, rule 2 also matches every detector that publishes no voltage, and a real
leak on the NVSwitch tray would route to the contamination runbook. Shipping only rule 1
would suppress all three captured events outright. If you take one rule rather than three,
take the bare `..._state == 3` — the classification refines the alert, it never filters it.

Coverage varies by platform, so `..._state` is the only signal available everywhere:

- **GB300 compute tray (ARS-121GL-NB3):** 4 detectors on the tray shelf chassis, each with
  a companion `Sensor` giving `..._volts` and its thresholds. These are resistive moisture
  ropes on a voltage divider — dry reads high (~1.72 V) and water pulls the voltage *down*
  toward the lower critical threshold, so the leak alarm is a **lower** critical crossing.
  The threshold value is firmware-dependent (1.3 V and 1.65 V both appear across captured
  trays), which is why it is exported as a metric rather than written into an alert. It is
  only exposed on the `Sensor` resource, never in the telemetry metric report.
  `..._volts_upper_threshold_critical` (2.0 V where reported) is *not* a wetter-still
  reading: an open or shorted sense line reads high, so crossing it means the detector has
  stopped being able to see a leak.
- **MGX NVSwitch tray (P3809):** 7 detectors (including an aggregate, `leakage_aggr`) on one
  chassis, with six further chassis exposing an empty detector collection. Discrete only —
  no companion voltage sensors. Note the aggregate is structurally indistinguishable from
  the individual detectors, so an unqualified alert will fire twice for one physical leak.
- Some BMCs advertise a `LeakDetection` link that then returns 404; this is logged at debug
  level and emits nothing.

The companion voltages are correlated by Id against the `LeakDetector` resources enumerated
from `ThermalSubsystem`, and nothing in a `Sensor` payload identifies one on its own — no
`PhysicalContext`, no marker, and `RelatedItem` points only at the system. So whenever that
enumeration does not happen, those sensors are not recognised and fold into the generic
voltage family: `redfish_chassis_leak_detector_volts` disappears and the same reading
reappears as `redfish_chassis_power_voltage_volts{power_voltage_id="..._LeakDetector_..."}`.
That happens when `disable_thermal_subsystem` is set, and transiently whenever the
`ThermalSubsystem` request fails. There is no fallback available.

This is the reason to **alert on the absence of `redfish_chassis_leak_detector_state`**, not
only on its value. A tray whose detectors have stopped being reported looks exactly like a dry
tray to any alert written on the value alone.

#### Configuration

```yaml
chassis_collector:
  # Regular expressions matched against each chassis Id. Include is applied first.
  [ chassis_include: <regexp> ]
  [ chassis_exclude: <regexp> ]

  # Regular expression matched against each Sensor Id. Matching sensors emit no metrics.
  # Trims series count, not request count: the collection arrives in one request either
  # way. Leak detector sensors are never excluded by this pattern.
  #
  # Omitting the key and setting it to "" are different: omitted means the default below,
  # empty means exclude nothing.
  [ sensor_exclude: <regexp> | default = "_CoreUtil_[0-9]+$" ]

  # Subsystem opt-outs. Every default is false, so an empty config collects everything.
  [ disable_thermal: <bool> ]
  [ disable_thermal_subsystem: <bool> ]   # also disables leak detection
  [ disable_power: <bool> ]
  [ disable_network_adapters: <bool> ]
  [ disable_sensors: <bool> ]             # also drops the leak detector voltages
```

`sensor_exclude` defaults to `"_CoreUtil_[0-9]+$"`. A GB300 tray publishes 144 per-core CPU
utilisation sensors, which is more series than the rest of the chassis collector produces
for that tray combined, and the same data is available in-band from `node_exporter` at
higher resolution. The telemetry collector already declines the identical sensors, so this
keeps the two collectors from disagreeing about the same hardware; expressing it as a
configuration default rather than as a rule in the collector keeps the judgement visible and
overridable, and leaves the collector free of any inference from sensor names.

The default applies wherever the key is absent — a hand-written `chassis_collector:` block,
`chassis_collector: {}`, and the built-in modules all behave identically. To collect those
sensors, set the pattern to the empty string:

```yaml
chassis_collector:
  sensor_exclude: ""
```

##### Scraping leak detection on a short interval

A full chassis scrape walks every chassis and can issue over a hundred requests on a tray
with many chassis, which at the default `max_concurrent_requests: 1` serialises. The
built-in `leak_detection` module trims that to what a leak alert needs:

```yaml
modules:
  leak_detection:
    prober: chassis_collector
    chassis_collector:
      disable_thermal: true
      disable_power: true
      disable_network_adapters: true
      # Optional, and vendor specific. Worth setting: it is the difference between
      # walking every chassis and walking only the one that carries detectors.
      # Supermicro NVL72 compute tray:
      # chassis_include: "^Chassis_[0-9]+$"
      # MGX NVSwitch tray:
      # chassis_include: "^MGX_BMC_[0-9]+$"
```

Setting `disable_thermal` and `disable_power` together does more than skip those two
fetches: it also narrows the `Sensors` pass to the leak detectors. Without that, on exactly
the liquid-cooled platforms this module targets — where no chassis implements either legacy
schema — `Sensors` would stand in for what was just disabled and the module would cost
almost as much as a full scrape.

Measured requests per scrape, against captured dumps:

| | full chassis scrape | `leak_detection` | + `chassis_include` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARS-121GL-NB3 (GB300 tray) | 124 | 78 | 11 |
| N5500_LD (MGX NVSwitch tray) | 48 | 42 | 14 |
| SYS-A21GE-NBRT (B200) | 115 | 64 | — |

`chassis_include` and `chassis_exclude` are applied to the collection's member links before
any chassis body is fetched, so a filtered scrape costs one request per *matching* chassis
rather than one per chassis. That is what makes the module cheap enough to poll on a short
interval: an unfiltered `leak_detection` scrape of a GB300 tray spends 43 of its 78 requests
just enumerating the forty-two chassis it is about to discard.

Filtering costs one extra request per scrape — the service root, read to find the
`ChassisCollection` link rather than assuming it — and matches on the trailing segment of
each member URI, which by Redfish convention is the chassis `Id`. The pattern is applied
again to the fetched `Id`, so a BMC that breaks that convention filters correctly, just
without the saving.

### `<gpu_collector>`
[source](../collector/gpu_collector.go)

The GPU Collector primarily exposes a wealth of Nvidia GPU-related data using a mix of Oem and Processor API data.
**Note:** This collector iterates many Redfish paths and depending on network round trips, may take a significant amount of time (30+ seconds) to return data.

Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

```text

### `<json_collector>`
[source](../collector/json_collector.go)

The JSON Collector allows probing Redfish APIs at a user-defined path, and deriving Prometheus gauge values from the result by use of JQ (using [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq) in particular).

The intent of this collector is to allow for greater end-user flexibility and agility in heterogeneous hardware environments.

OEM data is one good example of this; OEMs often evolve their own specific extensions and data faster than those updates percolate to Redfish libraries or even into publicly-available documentation. In those cases, the JSON collector may be a good fit to emit telemetry from arbitrary endpoints versus extending existing or adding new collectors to the core codebase to cover edge cases in OEM Redfish implementations.

Care should be taken when using this prober. Telemetry data is only as useful as it is both clear and understandable. Both of those criteria require finesse for what is at its core a transparent transformer around JSON data.

**NOTE:** Internally, the collector emits Gauge values. Care must be taken to collect and emit gauge-like data (power and fan data are good examples of gauges). Counter values _may_ work, but would not be canonically correct for use in Prometheus.

A recommended development cycle for this prober might be:
- Save the raw JSON output from a desired Redfish API path
- Iterate on the JQ script locally, targeting that saved output. See below for details on required JSON schema.
- Load the script and redfish path into a local copy of the redfish_exporter config (see below)
- Perform a single scrape through the exporter, backtesting against the same original source system
- Iterate on the script, if necessary

In order to transform data, the prober needs to execute a JQ script which yields data in the following output format:

``` json5
[
{
  # name of the resulting Prometheus timeseries
  "name": "<string>",
  # help text for the series. Prefer a static string, multiple values for a help string for the same timeseries name is invalid to Prometheus and will result in errors
  "help": "<string>",
  # value of the timeseries. Must be a float64.
  "value": <float64>,
  # OPTIONAL labels to assign to the timeseries.
  "labels": {
    "<string>": "<string>"
  }
},
...
]
```

This output is iterated over in the code, and gauge values are emitted as a result.

``` yaml
# Configurable timeout context, JQ parsing _must_ complete within this timeout.
context_timeout: <timeout> | default = 30s
# Redfish API path to probe
redfishPath: <string>
# JQ script to execute against the redfishPath. Note that the resulting format must match what is documented above.
jq: <string>
```

Examples of how this prober might be configured may be found in the [config testdata directory](../config/testdata/), and we welcome contributions adding more exotic ones.

### `<manager_collector>`
[source](../collector/manager_collector.go)

The Manager Collector exposes health data from the Manager API (e.g. the BMC itself). Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

```
# HELP redfish_manager_health_state manager health,1(OK),2(Warning),3(Critical)
# TYPE redfish_manager_health_state gauge

# HELP redfish_manager_power_state manager power state
# TYPE redfish_manager_power_state gauge

# TYPE redfish_manager_state gauge
```

Exposes no user configuration.

### `<system_collector>`
[source](../collector/system_collector.go)

The System Collector primarily exposes health data from the Systems API, as well as some amount of capacity and PCIe data. Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

### `<telemetry_collector>`
[source](../collector/telemetry_collector.go)

The Telemetry Collector exposes a wealth of data using the TelemetryService API.
It was designed to capture much OEM data for Nvidia systems, and as such may not be less useful in non-GPU hardware environments.
Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

## Regenerating the above metrics HELP/TYPE

Maybe a good automation target? Until then, for a given `${TARGET}` representing expected output and given a specific `${MODULE}`, GNU AWK will save the day for wholesale replacing of the above examples:

```shell
curl -s "http://localhost:9610/redfish?target=${TARGET}&module=${MODULE}" | awk '/^# (TYPE|HELP)/ { if (/^# TYPE/) {print; print ""} else {print} }'
```
