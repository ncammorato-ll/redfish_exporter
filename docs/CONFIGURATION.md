# Configuration

Generic types include:

- `<string>` regular string values
- `<float64>` regular float64 value as expected in Golang
- `<timeout>` a string representation of a Golang time.Duration, e.g. `30s`

```yaml
hosts:
  [ <string>: <hostdetail> ]
  default: <hostdetail>
groups:
  [ <string>: <hostdetail> ]
modules: [ <string>: <module> ]
```

## `<hostdetail>`
``` yaml
username: <string>
password: <string>
```

Note that the `default` entry above is useful in order to avoid the exporter failing when attempting to collect from a host not explicitly defined in `hosts`.

## `<module>`
Users of `blackbox_exporter` will be familiar with the concept of [modules (aka probers)](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md#module).
Since `v0.2.0-alpha` released in October 2025, this fork of the redfish_exporter supports a similar concept.
With modules, users may enable only certain bits of collector behavior, tailoring data gathering to specific hosts.
As an example, a host without GPUs wouldn't want to spend network round-trips using the `gpu_collector` prober module, and that may be left out on the client (Prometheus) end.

**Note:** To retain backwards compatibility, the redfish_exporter will default to probing a system using all collectors below except the JSON collector. If this is not desired behavior, users must define a `modules:` configuration in the redfish_exporter, and specify one or more `module` HTTP query parameters on the client end.

**In a future release, users will be required to specify modules in the exporter and client**

Modules follow the below configuration schema:

``` yaml
# The type of prober this module uses
prober: <prober_string>

[ chassis_collector: <chassis_collector> ]
[ gpu_collector: <gpu_collector> ]
[ json_collector: <json_collector> ]
[ manager_collector: <manager_collector> ]
[ system_collector: <system_collector> ]
[ telemetry_collector: <telemetry_collector> ]
```

### `<prober_string>`

One of:

- `chassis_collector`
- `gpu_collector`
- `json_collector`
- `manager_collector`
- `system_collector`
- `telemetry_collector`

### `<chassis_collector>`
[source](../collector/chassis_collector.go)

The Chassis Collector primarily exposes health data from the Chassis API. Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

```
# HELP redfish_chassis_health health of chassis,1(OK),2(Warning),3(Critical)
# TYPE redfish_chassis_health gauge

# HELP redfish_chassis_health_rollup health rollup of chassis,1(OK),2(Warning),3(Critical)
# TYPE redfish_chassis_health_rollup gauge

# HELP redfish_chassis_leak_detector_health chassis leak detector health state,1(OK),2(Warning),3(Critical)
# TYPE redfish_chassis_leak_detector_health gauge

# HELP redfish_chassis_model_info organization responsible for producing the chassis, the name by which the manufacturer generally refers to the chassis, and a part number and sku assigned by the organization that is responsible for producing or manufacturing the chassis
# TYPE redfish_chassis_model_info gauge

# HELP redfish_chassis_network_adapter_state chassis network adapter state,1(Enabled),2(Disabled),3(StandbyOffinline),4(StandbySpare),5(InTest),6(Starting),7(Absent),8(UnavailableOffline),9(Deferring),10(Quiesced),11(Updating)
# TYPE redfish_chassis_network_adapter_state gauge

# HELP redfish_chassis_state state of chassis,1(Enabled),2(Disabled),3(StandbyOffinline),4(StandbySpare),5(InTest),6(Starting),7(Absent),8(UnavailableOffline),9(Deferring),10(Quiesced),11(Updating)
# TYPE redfish_chassis_state gauge
```

Newer platforms — notably the GB200/GB300 NVL72 trays and the MGX NVSwitch tray — do not
implement the deprecated `Thermal` and `Power` schemas at all, and express the same
readings through `Sensors` instead. For those chassis the collector falls back to the
`Sensors` collection, folding readings into the metric families above wherever the meaning
is unambiguous, so a Sensors-only platform produces the same series names as one that
implements `Thermal`/`Power`:

| Redfish `ReadingType` | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| `Temperature` | `redfish_chassis_temperature_celsius` (+ `_sensor_health`, `_sensor_state`) |
| `Rotational` | `redfish_chassis_fan_rpm` (+ min/max/percentage/threshold series) |
| `Voltage` | `redfish_chassis_power_voltage_volts` (+ `_state`) |
| anything else | `redfish_chassis_sensor_{watts,amperes,joules,hertz,percent,reading}` |

The collection is consulted only on a chassis that advertises neither `Thermal` nor `Power`.
Collecting it alongside them would publish that chassis's temperatures twice under the same
series name, which fails the whole scrape at registration rather than merely thinning it.

A chassis advertising no `Sensors` collection is never asked for one. This matters more
than it sounds: the `ERoT`/`IRoT` roots are roughly a third of the chassis on an NVL72 tray
or an HGX baseboard, and synthesising `<chassis>/Sensors` for them would cost a 404 apiece
on every scrape.

Readings are not inferred from sensor naming: fan PWM duty cycle and CPU core utilisation
are both `ReadingType: Percent` and neither carries a distinguishing `PhysicalContext`, so
`Percent` reaches the catch-all rather than being assumed to be a fan speed.

The collection is fetched with `$expand` so the BMC inlines every member body, costing one
request per chassis rather than one per sensor. A BMC that does not honour `$expand` is
**not** fanned out to one request per sensor — that would multiply load against the BMCs
least able to absorb it — so the bulk sensor telemetry is skipped with a warning instead.

Exposes no user configuration.

### `<gpu_collector>`
[source](../collector/gpu_collector.go)

The GPU Collector primarily exposes a wealth of Nvidia GPU-related data using a mix of Oem and Processor API data.
**Note:** This collector iterates many Redfish paths and depending on network round trips, may take a significant amount of time (30+ seconds) to return data.

Against a Lambda lab system, the collector yields the following timeseries:

```text

### `<json_collector>`
[source](../collector/json_collector.go)

The JSON Collector allows probing Redfish APIs at a user-defined path, and deriving Prometheus gauge values from the result by use of JQ (using [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq) in particular).

The intent of this collector is to allow for greater end-user flexibility and agility in heterogeneous hardware environments.

OEM data is one good example of this; OEMs often evolve their own specific extensions and data faster than those updates percolate to Redfish libraries or even into publicly-available documentation. In those cases, the JSON collector may be a good fit to emit telemetry from arbitrary endpoints versus extending existing or adding new collectors to the core codebase to cover edge cases in OEM Redfish implementations.

Care should be taken when using this prober. Telemetry data is only as useful as it is both clear and understandable. Both of those criteria require finesse for what is at its core a transparent transformer around JSON data.

**NOTE:** Internally, the collector emits Gauge values. Care must be taken to collect and emit gauge-like data (power and fan data are good examples of gauges). Counter values _may_ work, but would not be canonically correct for use in Prometheus.

A recommended development cycle for this prober might be:
- Save the raw JSON output from a desired Redfish API path
- Iterate on the JQ script locally, targeting that saved output. See below for details on required JSON schema.
- Load the script and redfish path into a local copy of the redfish_exporter config (see below)
- Perform a single scrape through the exporter, backtesting against the same original source system
- Iterate on the script, if necessary

In order to transform data, the prober needs to execute a JQ script which yields data in the following output format:

``` json5
[
{
  # name of the resulting Prometheus timeseries
  "name": "<string>",
  # help text for the series. Prefer a static string, multiple values for a help string for the same timeseries name is invalid to Prometheus and will result in errors
  "help": "<string>",
  # value of the timeseries. Must be a float64.
  "value": <float64>,
  # OPTIONAL labels to assign to the timeseries.
  "labels": {
    "<string>": "<string>"
  }
},
...
]
```

This output is iterated over in the code, and gauge values are emitted as a result.

``` yaml
# Configurable timeout context, JQ parsing _must_ complete within this timeout.
context_timeout: <timeout> | default = 30s
# Redfish API path to probe
redfishPath: <string>
# JQ script to execute against the redfishPath. Note that the resulting format must match what is documented above.
jq: <string>
```

Examples of how this prober might be configured may be found in the [config testdata directory](../config/testdata/), and we welcome contributions adding more exotic ones.

### `<manager_collector>`

## Regenerating the above metrics HELP/TYPE

Maybe a good automation target? Until then, for a given `${TARGET}` representing expected output and given a specific `${MODULE}`, GNU AWK will save the day for wholesale replacing of the above examples:

```shell
curl -s "http://localhost:9610/redfish?target=${TARGET}&module=${MODULE}" | awk '/^# (TYPE|HELP)/ { if (/^# TYPE/) {print; print ""} else {print} }'
```
